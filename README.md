# SpeedLimiter

SpeedLimiter is a FiveM script that allows you to setup a maximum speed for all the vehicles!
It avoids you having to modify the handling file of each vehicle and prevents from having cars going 500 kmh on the map which was not designed for that.

## Config
Set **Config.kmh** to true if you want to use km/h or false if you want to use mph.
Set **Config.maxSpeed** to whatever limit you want to set.

## How does it work?
The script check when you are in a vehicle, if the vehicle is faster than the limit you set it will set that vehicle max speed to the limit you set on the config
